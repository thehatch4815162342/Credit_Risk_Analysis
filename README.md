# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Project Overview
A peer-to-peer lending service company would like to predict credit risk using machine learning. They would like to see the following:
  - Oversampling of the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms
  - Undersampling of the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm 
  - Combination sampling (over and under) using the SMOTEENN algorithm
  - Comparison between the BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifer machine learning models
